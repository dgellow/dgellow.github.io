      <description>As I wanted to play a bit with Google&amp;rsquo;s Appengine, and to do some programming with my partner in life, we created together a simple bot for the chat application Telegram. The bot, available at @MovieReleasesBot, allows people to list incoming movie releases and subscribe to them to receive a notification a few days before the actual release.
The complete code is available at https://github.com/dgellow/movie-releases. Given that this project is something we do during our weekends and that my partner doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a programming background be aware that nothing here is optimized in any way, or covered by tests, or anything that would be considered production ready.</description>

      <description>I recently decided to organize my thoughts, ideas, and projects a bit better given that they are currently spread around in GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and multiple computers and (physical) notebooks. As part of this move I setup this website and blog, that will be available (or already is) at www.dgellow.me (newly released TLD for a fresh start!).
I would like to use it as my personal tool, a place where I can share current thoughts and ideas, find past ones, centralize documentation and showcase of some projects, and see my progression, learning, improvement over time.</description>

      <description>Because recursivity is funny ðŸ˜ƒ.
More seriously, I would like to improve my writing, have a place with my thoughts and projects, and see if I can keep a blog up to date. Thus this website.</description>
