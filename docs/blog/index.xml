      <description>I recently decided to organize my thoughts, ideas, and projects a bit better given that they are currently spread around in GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and multiple computers and (physical) notebooks. As part of this move I setup this website and blog, that will be available (or already is) at www.dgellow.me (newly released TLD for a fresh start!).
I would like to use it as my personal tool, a place where I can share current thoughts and ideas, find past ones, centralize documentation and showcase of some projects, and see my progression, learning, improvement over time.</description>
