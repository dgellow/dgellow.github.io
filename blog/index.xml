      <description>I recently decided to organize my thoughts, ideas, and projects a bit, they are currently spread around GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and multiple computers and (physical) notebooks. As part of this move I created this website and blog that will be available (or already is) at dgellow.dev (newly released TLD for a fresh start!).
I plan to use it as a personal tool, a place where I can share current thoughts and ideas, easily find past ones, centralize documentation and showcase of some projects, and see my progression, learning and general improvement over time.</description>
