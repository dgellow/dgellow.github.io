I recently decided to organize my thoughts, ideas, and projects a bit better given that they are currently spread around in GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab, and multiple computers and (physical) notebooks. As part of this move I setup this website and blog, that will be available (or already is) at [dgellow.me](https://dgellow.me) (newly released TLD for a fresh start!).

I would like to use it as my personal tool, a place where I can share current thoughts and ideas, find past ones, centralize documentation and showcase of some projects, and see my progression, learning, improvement over time.

Some projects will surely seem silly, some blog posts will feel written by a complete beginner or not bring value. That's expected. The main audience of this site is myself, it is my personal place where I'm free to share what I want, at my own rythm.

Let's see how this project evolve üòÅ.
