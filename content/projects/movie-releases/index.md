As I wanted to play a bit with Google's Appengine, and to do some programming with my partner in life, we created together a simple bot for the chat application [Telegram](https://telegram.org). The bot, available at [@MovieReleasesBot](https://telegram.me/MovieReleasesBot), allows people to list incoming movie releases and subscribe to them to receive a notification a few days before the actual release.

The complete code is available at https://github.com/dgellow/movie-releases. Given that this project is something we do during our weekends and that my partner doesn't have a programming background be aware that nothing here is optimized in any way, or covered by tests, or anything that would be considered production ready.

Still a fun little project ðŸ™‚ I like to spend some time on from time to time (and that gives us some great whiteboard sessions!).
