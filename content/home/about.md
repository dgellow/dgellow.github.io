This is **Samuel El-Borai** (aka **dgellow**) personal website. Projects and blog articles showcased or posted here are things I work on during my free time, sometime to solve I issue I have, sometime as part of my continuous learning, or just to satisfy my curiosity.

My interests are varied but expect to see content related to **Go**/Golang as it currently is my main programming language. I'm also learning **C++**, game and graphics programming, so that will surely become some of the main topics over time.

Feel free to look around, and share things you find interesting. And don't hesitate to [contact](#contact) me for comments or other reasons.

This website is strictly **personal** and doesn't represent my professional experience, send me an email if that's what you're looking for.
